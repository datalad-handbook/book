should be specified with an -o/--output flag. Upon a run or rerun of
the command, the contents of these files will get unlocked so that

empty), datalad run will not work - you will have to save
modifications present in your dataset.
A suboptimal alternative is the --explicit flag, used to record only
those changes done to the files listed with --output flags.
