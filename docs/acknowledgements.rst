Acknowledgements
----------------

The DataLad software and its documentation are the joint work of more than 100 individuals.
We are deeply grateful for these contributions to free and open source software (FOSS) and documentation.
Likewise we are grateful to the many more people that produce and maintain the FOSS ecosystem that DataLad is built on.
We are particularly indebted to Joey Hess, the author of the git-annex software, without which DataLad would not be what it is today.
