# navigate back into the original dataset
$ cd ../../DataLad-101
# write the note
$ cat << EOT >> notes.txt
A source to install a dataset from can also be a path,
for example as in "datalad clone ../DataLad-101".

Just as in creating datasets, you can add a
description on the location of the new dataset clone
with the -D/--description option.

Note that subdatasets will not be installed by default,
but are only registered in the superdataset -- you will
have to do a "datalad get -n PATH/TO/SUBDATASET"
to install the subdataset for file availability meta data.
The -n/--no-data options prevents that file contents are
also downloaded.

Note that a recursive "datalad get" would install all further
registered subdatasets underneath a subdataset, so a safer
way to proceed is to set a decent --recursion-limit:
"datalad get -n -r --recursion-limit 2 <subds>"
