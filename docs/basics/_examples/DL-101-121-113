$ cat << EOT >> notes.txt
To update from a dataset with a shared history, you need to add this
dataset as a sibling to your dataset. "Adding a sibling" means
providing DataLad with info about the location of a dataset, and a
name for it.
Afterwards, a "datalad update --how merge -s name" will integrate the
changes made to the sibling into the dataset. A safe step in between
is to do a "datalad update -s name" and checkout the changes with
"git/datalad diff" to remotes/origin/main
