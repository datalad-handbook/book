Dataset hosting on GIN
----------------------

`GIN <https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki>`__ (G-Node infrastructure) is a
free data management system designed for comprehensive and reproducible management
of scientific data. It is a web-based repository store and provides
fine-grained access control to share data. :term:`GIN` builds up on :term:`Git` and
:term:`git-annex`, and is an easy alternative to other third-party services to host
and share your DataLad datasets [#f1]_.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use GIN for hosting and sharing your datasets, you need to

- register
- upload your public :term:`SSH key` for SSH access
- create an empty repository on GIN and publish your dataset to it

Once you have `registered <https://gin.g-node.org/user/sign_up>`_
an account on the GIN server by providing your e-mail address, affiliation,
and name, and selecting a user name and password, you should upload your
:term:`SSH key` to allow SSH access.

.. findoutmore:: What is an SSH key and how can I create one?

   An SSH key is an access credential in the :term:`SSH` protocol that can be used
   to login from one system to remote servers and services, such as from your private
   computer to an :term:`SSH server`. For repository hosting services such as :term:`GIN`,
   :term:`GitHub`, or :term:`GitLab`, it can be used to connect and authenticate
   without supplying your username or password for each action.

   This `tutorial by GitHub <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_
   is a detailed step-by-step instruction to generate and use SSH keys for authentication,
   and it also shows you how to add your public SSH key to your GitHub account
   so that you can install or clone datasets or Git repositories via ``SSH`` (in addition
   to the ``http`` protocol), and the same procedure applies to GitLab and Gin.

   Don't be intimidated if you have never done this before -- it is fast and easy:
   First, you need to create a private and a public key (an SSH key pair).
   All this takes is a single command in the terminal. The resulting files are
   text files that look like someone spilled alphabet soup in them, but constitute
   a secure password procedure.
   You keep the private key on your own machine (the system you are connecting from,
   and that **only you have access to**),
   and copy the public key to the system or service you are connecting to.
   On the remote system or service, you make the public key an *authorized key* to
   allow authentication via the SSH key pair instead of your password. This
   either takes a single command in the terminal, or a few clicks in a web interface
   to achieve.
   You should protect your SSH keys on your machine with a passphrase to prevent
   others -- e.g., in case of theft -- to log in to servers or services with
   SSH authentication [#f2]_, and configure an ``ssh agent``
   to handle this passphrase for you with a single command. How to do all of this
   is detailed in the above tutorial.

To do this, visit the settings of your user account. On the left hand side, select
the tab "SSH Keys", and click the button "Add Key":

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/GIN_SSH_1.png

You should copy the contents of your public key file into the field labeled
``content``, and enter an arbitrary but informative ``Key Name``, such as
"My private work station". Afterwards, you are done!


Publishing your dataset to GIN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To publish an existing dataset to GIN, create a new, empty repository on GIN first.
Unlike with :command:`datalad create-sibling-github` (that does this step automatically
for you on :term:`GitHub`), this needs to be done via the web interface:

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/GIN_newrepo.png

Afterwards, add this repository as a sibling of your dataset. To do this, use the
:command:`datalad siblings add` command and the SSH URL of the repository as shown below.
Note that since this is the first time you will be connecting to the GIN server
via SSH, you will likely be asked to confirm to connect. This is a safety measure,
and you can type "yes" to continue::

    $ datalad siblings add -d . --name gin --url git@gin.g-node.org:/adswa/DataLad-101.git

    The authenticity of host 'gin.g-node.org (141.84.41.219)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:E35RRG3bhoAm/WD+0dqKpFnxJ9+yi0uUiFLi+H/lkdU.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    [INFO   ] Failed to enable annex remote gin, could be a pure git or not accessible
    [WARNING] Failed to determine if gin carries annex.
    .: gin(-) [git@gin.g-node.org:/adswa/DataLad-101.git (git)]

.. ifconfig:: internal

    .. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-139-101
       :language: console
       :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
       :realcommand: python -c "from datalad.core.distributed.tests.test_push import mk_push_target; from datalad.api import Dataset as ds; mk_push_target(ds=ds('/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101'), name='gin', path='/home/me/pushes/DataLad-101', annex=True, bare=True)"


Afterwards, you can publish your dataset with :command:`datalad push`. As the
repository on GIN supports a dataset annex, there is no publication dependency
to an external data hosting service necessary, and the dataset contents
stored in Git and in git-annex are published to the same place:


 .. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-139-102
    :language: console
    :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

    $ datalad push --to gin

If you refresh the GIN web interface afterwards, you will find all of your dataset
-- including annexed contents! -- on GIN. What is especially cool is that the
GIN web interface (unlike :term:`GitHub`) can even preview your annexed contents.

.. _subdspublishing:

Subdataset publishing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Just as the input subdataset ``iris_data`` in your published ``midterm_project``
was referencing its source on :term:`GitHub`, the ``longnow`` subdataset in your
published ``DataLad-101`` dataset directly references the original
dataset on :term:`GitHub`. If you click onto ``recordings`` and then ``longnow``, you will
be redirected to the podcast's original dataset.

The subdataset ``midterm_project``, however, is not successfully referenced. If
you click on it, you would get to a 404 Error page. The crucial difference between this
subdataset and the longnow dataset is its entry in the ``.gitmodules`` file of
``DataLad-101``:

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 4, 8

   $ cat .gitmodules
   [submodule "recordings/longnow"]
           path = recordings/longnow
           url = https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git
           datalad-id = b3ca2718-8901-11e8-99aa-a0369f7c647e
   [submodule "midterm_project"]
           path = midterm_project
           url = ./midterm_project
           datalad-id = e5a3d370-223d-11ea-af8b-e86a64c8054c

While the podcast subdataset is referenced with a valid URL to GitHub, the midterm
project's URL is a relative path from the root of the superdataset. This is because
the ``longnow`` subdataset was installed with :command:`datalad clone -d .`
(that records the source of the subdataset), and the ``midterm_project`` dataset
was created as a subdataset with :command:`datalad create -d . midterm_project`.
Since there is no repository at
``https://gin.g-node.org/<USER>/DataLad-101/midterm_project`` (which this submodule
entry would resolve to), accessing the subdataset fails.

However, since you have already published this dataset (to GitHub), you could
update the submodule entry and provide the accessible GitHub URL instead. This
can be done via the ``set-property <NAME> <VALUE>`` option of
:command:`datalad subdatasets` [#f3]_ (replace the URL shown here with the URL
your dataset was published to -- likely, you only need to change the user name):

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-139-103
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ datalad subdatasets --contains midterm_project --set-property url https://github.com/adswa/midtermproject

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-139-104
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ cat .gitmodules

Handily, the :command:`datalad subdatasets` command saved this change to the
``.gitmodules`` file automatically and the state of the dataset is clean:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-139-105
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ datalad status

Afterwards, publish these changes to ``gin`` and see for yourself how this fixed
the problem:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-139-106
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ datalad push --to gin

If the subdataset was not published before, you could publish the subdataset to
a location of your choice, and modify the ``.gitmodules`` entry accordingly.

Sharing the dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your dataset is published, you can point collaborators and friends to it.
The "Collaboration" tab under Settings lets you set fine-grained access rights,
and it is possible to share datasets with collaborators that are not registered
on GIN.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] GIN looks and feels similar to GitHub, and among a number advantages, it can
         assign a :term:`DOI` to your dataset, making it cite-able. Moreover, its
         `web interface <https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/WebInterface>`_
         and `client <https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GinUsageTutorial>`_ are
         useful tools with a variety of features that are worthwhile to check out, as well.

.. [#f2] Your private SSH key is incredibly valuable, and it is important to keep
         it secret!
         Anyone who gets your private key has access to anything that the public key
         is protecting. If the private key does not have a passphrase, simply copying
         this file grants a person access!

.. [#f3] Alternatively, you can configure the siblings url with :command:`git config`::

           $ git config -f .gitmodules --replace-all  submodule.midterm_project.url https://github.com/adswa/midtermproject

         Remember, though, that this command modifies ``.gitmodules`` *without*
         an automatic, subsequent :command:`save`, so that you will have to save
         this change manually.
