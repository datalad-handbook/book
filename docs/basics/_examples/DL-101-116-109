$ # navigate back into the original dataset
$ cd ../../DataLad-101
$ # write the note
$ cat << EOT >> notes.txt
A source to install a dataset from can also be a path, for example as
in "datalad clone ../DataLad-101".

Just as in creating datasets, you can add a description on the
location of the new dataset clone with the -D/--description option.

Note that subdatasets will not be installed by default, but are only
registered in the superdataset -- you will have to do a
"datalad get -n PATH/TO/SUBDATASET" to install the subdataset for file
availability meta data. The -n/--no-data options prevents that file
contents are also downloaded.

Note that a recursive "datalad get" would install all further
registered subdatasets underneath a subdataset, so a safer way to
proceed is to set a decent --recursion-limit:
"datalad get -n -r --recursion-limit 2 <subds>"
