Working in (sub-)datasets from afar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Up until now, we made sure to diligently ``cd`` into the precise dataset or
subdataset we wanted to work with. This was straightforward and easy, but, to
be honest, you found it slightly annoying from time to time as well.

Luckily, Git has an option to run commands in a path different from the current
working directory: ``-C`` (note that it is a capital C). Providing this
option together with a path to any Git command let's you run the command as
if Git was started in this path instead of the current working directory.
