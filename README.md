# The Datalad handbook :orange_book:

This is a living resource on why and - more importantly - *how* to use [DataLad](www.datalad.org).
The rendered version is [here](http://handbook.datalad.org): http://handbook.datalad.org, and is currently
under initial development.

The handbook is a practical, hands-on crashcourse to learn and experience DataLad.
You do not need to be a programmer, computer scientist, or Linux-crank. If you have never touched your computer's shell before, you will be fine. Regardless of your background and personal use cases for DataLad, the handbook will show you the principles of DataLad, and from chapter 1 onwards you will be using them.

## Contributing

Contributions in any form - pull requests, issues, content requests/ideas, ... are always welcome. If you are using the handbook and find that something does not work, please [let us know](https://github.com/datalad-handbook/book/issues/new). Likewise, if you are using DataLad for your individual project, consider contributing by telling us about your use-case. You can find out more on how to contribute [here](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/contributing.html).
