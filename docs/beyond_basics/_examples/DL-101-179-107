[INFO] Could not enable annex remote public. This is expected if public is a pure Git remote, or happens if it is not accessible. 
[WARNING] Could not detect whether public carries an annex. If public is a pure Git remote, this is expected. Remote was marked by annex as annex-ignore. Edit .git/config to reset if you think that was done by mistake due to absent connection etc
