$ cat notes.txt
One can create a new dataset with 'datalad create [--description] PATH'.
The dataset is created empty

The command "datalad save [-m] PATH" saves the file
(modifications) to history. Note to self:
Always use informative, concise commit messages.

The command 'datalad clone URL/PATH [PATH]'
installs a dataset from e.g., a URL or a path.
If you install a dataset into an existing
dataset (as a subdataset), remember to specify the
root of the superdataset with the '-d' option.

There are two useful functions to display changes between two
states of a dataset: "datalad diff -f/--from COMMIT -t/--to COMMIT"
and "git diff COMMIT COMMIT", where COMMIT is a shasum of a commit
in the history.

The datalad run command can record the impact a script or command has on a Dataset.
In its simplest form, datalad run only takes a commit message and the command that
should be executed.

Any datalad run command can be re-executed by using its commit shasum as an argument
in datalad rerun CHECKSUM. DataLad will take information from the run record of the original
commit, and re-execute it. If no changes happen with a rerun, the command will not be written
to history. Note: you can also rerun a datalad rerun command!
