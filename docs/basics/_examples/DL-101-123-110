Configurations for datasets exist on different levels
(systemwide, global, and local), and in different types
of files (not version controlled (git)config files, or
version controlled .datalad/config, .gitattributes, or
gitmodules files), or environment variables.
With the exception of .gitattributes, all configuration
files share a common structure, and can be modified with
the git config command, but also with an editor by hand.

Depending on whether a configuration file is version
controlled or not, the configurations will be shared together
with the dataset. More specific configurations and not-shared
configurations will always take precedence over more global or
shared configurations, and environment variables take precedence
over configurations in files.

The git config --list --show-origin command is a useful tool
to give an overview over existing configurations. Particularly
important may be the .gitattributes file, in which one can set
rules for git-annex about which files should be version-controlled
with Git instead of being annexed.
