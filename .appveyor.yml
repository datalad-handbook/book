# This CI setup provides a largely homogeneous configuration across all
# major platforms (Windows, MacOS, and Linux). The aim of this test setup is
# to create a "native" platform experience, using as few cross-platform
# helper tools as possible.
#
# On Linux/Mac a virtualenv is used for testing. The effective virtual env
# is available under ~/VENV.
#
# All workers support remote login. Login details are shown at the top of each
# CI run log.
#
# - Linux/Mac workers (via SSH):
#
#   - A permitted SSH key must be defined in an APPVEYOR_SSH_KEY environment
#     variable (via the appveyor project settings)
#
#   - SSH login info is given in the form of: 'appveyor@67.225.164.xx -p 22xxx'
#
#   - Login with:
#
#     ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no <LOGIN>
#
#   - to prevent the CI run from exiting, `touch` a file named `BLOCK` in the
#     user HOME directory (current directory directly after login). The session
#     will run until the file is removed (or 60 min have passed)
#
# - Windows workers (via RDP):
#
#   - An RDP password should be defined in an APPVEYOR_RDP_PASSWORD environment
#     variable (via the appveyor project settings), or a random password is used
#     every time
#
#   - RDP login info is given in the form of IP:PORT
#
#   - Login with:
#
#     xfreerdp /cert:ignore /dynamic-resolution /u:appveyor /p:<PASSWORD> /v:<LOGIN>
#
#   - to prevent the CI run from exiting, create a textfile named `BLOCK` on the
#     Desktop (a required .txt extension will be added automatically). The session
#     will run until the file is removed (or 60 min have passed)
#
#   - in a terminal execute, for example, `C:\datalad_debug.bat 39` to set up the
#     environment to debug in a Python 3.8 session (should generally match the
#     respective CI run configuration).
