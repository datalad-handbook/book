Configurations for datasets exist on different levels (systemwide,
global, and local), and in different types of files (not version
controlled (git)config files, or version controlled .datalad/config,
.gitattributes, or gitmodules files), or environment variables.
With the exception of .gitattributes, all configuration files share a
common structure, and can be modified with the git config command, but
also with an editor by hand.

Depending on whether a configuration file is version controlled or
not, the configurations will be shared together with the dataset.
More specific configurations and not-shared configurations will always
take precedence over more global or hared configurations, and
environment variables take precedence over configurations in files.

The "git config --list --show-origin" command is a useful tool to give
an overview over existing configurations. Particularly important may
be the .gitattributes file, in which one can set rules for git-annex
about which files should be version-controlled with Git instead of
being annexed.
