Walk-through: Git LFS as a special remote on GitHub
---------------------------------------------------

Some repository hosting services provide for-pay support for large files, and can thus be used as special remotes as well.
GitHub and GitLab for example support `Git Large File Storage <https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs>`_ (Git LFS) for managing data files using Git.
A free GitHub subscription allows up to `1GB of free storage and up to 1GB of bandwidth monthly <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage>`_.
As such, it might be sufficient for some use cases, and could be configured
quite easily.

In order to store annexed dataset contents on GitHub, we need first to create a repository on GitHub::

    $ datalad create-sibling-github test-github-lfs --access-protocol ssh
    .: github(-) [git@github.com:yarikoptic/test-github-lfs.git (git)]
    'git@github.com:yarikoptic/test-github-lfs.git' configured as sibling 'github' for <Dataset path=/tmp/test-github-lfs>

and then initialize a :term:`special remote` of type ``git-lfs``, pointing to the same GitHub repository::

    $ git annex initremote github-lfs type=git-lfs url=git@github.com:yarikoptic/test-github-lfs autoenable=true encryption=none embedcreds=no

If you would like to compress data in Git LFS, you need to take a detour via
encryption during :gitannexcmd:`initremote` -- this has compression as a
convenient side effect. Here is an example initialization::

   $ git annex initremote --force github-lfs type=git-lfs url=git@github.com:yarikoptic/test-github-lfs autoenable=true encryption=shared

With this single step it becomes possible to transfer contents to GitHub::

    $ git annex copy --to=github-lfs file.dat
    copy file.dat (to github-lfs...)
    ok
    (recording state in git...)

and the entire dataset to the same GitHub repository::

    $ datalad push --to=github
    [INFO   ] Publishing <Dataset path=/tmp/test-github-lfs> to github
    publish(ok): . (dataset) [pushed to github: ['[new branch]', '[new branch]']]

Alternatively, to make publication even easier for you, the dataset provider, you can establish a :term:`publication dependency` such that a :dlcmd:`push` performs the data transfer to ``git-lfs`` automatically::

   $ datalad siblings configure -s github --publish-depends github-lfs
   # afterwards, only datalad push is needed to publish dataset contents and history
   $ datalad push --to github

Consumers of your dataset should be able to retrieve files right after cloning the dataset without a ``siblings enable`` command (as shown in the section :ref:`dropbox`), because of the ``autoenable=true`` configuration for the special remote.

.. importantnote:: No drop from LFS

   Unfortunately, it is impossible to :dlcmd:`drop` contents from Git LFS:
