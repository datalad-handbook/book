============
The Handbook
============

**Welcome!**

This handbook is a living resource about why and -- more importantly -- *how* to
use DataLad. It aims to provide novices and advanced users of all backgrounds
with both the basics of DataLad and start-to-end use cases of specific
applications. If you want to get hands-on experience and learn DataLad, the *Basics*
part of this book will teach you. If you want to know what is possible, the
*use cases* will show you. And if you want to help others to get started with DataLad,
the `companion repository <https://github.com/datalad-handbook/course>`_ provides
:ref:`free and open source teaching material <teach>` tailored to the handbook.

Before you read on, please note that this version of the handbook is based on **at least** DataLad version **0.17**, and the higher your version of DataLad is, the better.
The section :ref:`install` will set you up with what you need if you currently do not have DataLad 0.17 or higher installed.

.. importantnote:: Did you know ...

    ... that you can also easily get a **physical copy** of this book?
