The handbook should have provided plenty of insights into common usage patterns for DataLad.
When approaching the software not from a user perspective, but from a developer angle, you can find further information on the design principles and internal code structure in DataLad's Design Documents.
These documents are part of the developer docs at `docs.datalad.org <https://docs.datalad.org>`_ and constitute an ongoing effort to document and harmonize the development rules and processes.
Head over to `docs.datalad.org/design/index.html <https://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/design/index.html>`_ to find out more.
