Note that a recursive "datalad get" would install all further
registered subdatasets underneath a subdataset, so a safer way to
proceed is to set a decent --recursion-limit:
"datalad get -n -r --recursion-limit 2 <subds>"

The command "git annex whereis PATH" lists the repositories that have
the file content of an annexed file. When using "datalad get" to
retrieve file content, those repositories will be queried.
