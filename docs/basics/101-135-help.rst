How to get help
---------------

All DataLad errors or problems you encounter during ``DataLad-101`` are intentional
and serve illustrative purposes. But what if you run into any DataLad errors
outside of this course?
Fortunately, the syllabus has a whole section on that, and on
one lazy, warm summer-afternoon you flip through it.

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/reading.svg
   :width: 50%

You realize that you already know the most important things:
The number one advice on how to get help is
`"Read the error message." <https://poster.keepcalmandposters.com/default/5986752_keep_calm_and_read_the_error_message.png>`_.
The second advice it
`"I'm not kidding: Read the error message <https://images.app.goo.gl/GWQ82AAJnx1dWtWx6>`_.
The third advice, finally, says
`"Honestly, read the f***ing error message <https://images.app.goo.gl/ddxg4aowbji6XTrw7>`_.

Help yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you run into a DataLad problem and you have followed the three
steps above, but the error message
`does not give you a clue on how to proceed <https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality_3.png>`_,
the first you should do is

#. find out which *version* of DataLad you use

#. read the *help page* of the command that failed

The first step is important in order to find out whether a
command failed due to using a wrong DataLad version. In order
to use this book and follow along, your DataLad version
should be ``datalad-0.12`` or higher, for example.

To find out which version you are using, run

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-135-101
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101

   $ datalad --version

.. index:: ! datalad command; wtf

If you want a comprehensive overview of your full setup,
:command:`datalad wtf` [#f1]_ is the command to turn to
(:manpage:`datalad-wtf` manual). Running this command will
generate a report about the DataLad installation and configuration.
The output below shows an excerpt.

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-135-102
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :lines: 1-20

   $ datalad wtf

This lengthy output will report all information that might
be relevant -- from DataLad to :term:`git-annex` or Python
up to your operating system.

The second step, finding and reading the help page of the command
in question, is important in order to find out how the
command that failed is used. Are arguments specified correctly?
Does the help list any caveats?

There are multiple ways to find help on DataLad commands.
You could turn to the `documentation <http://docs.datalad.org/>`_.
Alternatively, to get help right inside the terminal,
run any command with the ``-h``/``--help`` option (also shown
as an excerpt here):

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-135-103
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :lines: 1-28, 72-108

   $ datalad get --help

This for example is the help page on :command:`datalad get`
(the same you would find in the `documentation <http://docs.datalad.org>`__,
but in your terminal, here - for brevity - slightly cut).
It contains a command description, a list
of all the available options with a short explanation of them, and
example commands. The paragraph *Options* shows all
optional flags, and all required parts of
the command are listed in the paragraph *Arguments*. One first thing
to check for example is whether your command call
specified all of the required arguments.

Asking questions (right)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If nothing you do on your own helps to solve the problem,
consider asking others. Check out `neurostars <https://neurostars.org/>`_
and search for your problem -- likely,
`somebody already encountered the same error before <http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png>`_
and fixed it, but if not, just ask a new question with a ``datalad`` tag.

Make sure your question is as informative as it can be for others.
Include

- *context* -- what did you want to do and why?

- the *problem* -- paste the error message (all of it), and provide the
  steps necessary to reproduce it.

- *technical details* -- what version of DataLad are you using, what version
  of git-annex, and which git-annex repository type, what is your operating
  system and -- if applicable -- Python version? :command:`datalad wtf` is your friend
  to find all of this information.

The "submit a question link" on `DataLad's GitHub page <https://neurostars.org/new-topic?body=-%20Please%20describe%20the%20problem.%0A-%20What%20steps%20will%20reproduce%20the%20problem%3F%0A-%20What%20version%20of%20DataLad%20are%20you%20using%20%28run%20%60datalad%20--version%60%29%3F%20On%20what%20operating%20system%20%28consider%20running%20%60datalad%20plugin%20wtf%60%29%3F%0A-%20Please%20provide%20any%20additional%20information%20below.%0A-%20Have%20you%20had%20any%20luck%20using%20DataLad%20before%3F%20%28Sometimes%20we%20get%20tired%20of%20reading%20bug%20reports%20all%20day%20and%20a%20lil%27%20positive%20end%20note%20does%20wonders%29&tags=datalad>`_
page prefills a neurostars form with a template for a question for a good
starting point if you want to have more guidance or encounter writer's block.

.. index:: Debugging

Debugging like a DataLad-developer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have read a command's help from start to end, checked all software versions twice, even `asked colleagues to reproduce your problem (unsuccessfully) <https://xkcd.com/2083/>`_, and you still don't have any clue what is going on, then welcome to the debugging section!

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/debug.svg
   :width: 50%

   It's not as bad as this

It is not always straightforward to see *why* a particular DataLad command has failed.
Given that operations with DataLad can be quite complicated, and could involve complexities such as different forms of authentication, different file systems, interactions with the environment, configurations, and other software, and *much* more, there are what may feel like an infinite amount of sources for the problem at hand.
The resulting error message, however, may not display the underlying cause correctly because the error message of whichever process failed is not propagated into the final result report.
Thus, you may end up with an uninformative ``Unable to access these remotes`` error in the result summary, when the underlying issue is a `certificate error <https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/4651#issuecomment-649180205>`_.

In situations where there is no obvious reason for a command to fail, it can be helpful -- either for yourself or for further information to paste into :term:`GitHub` issues -- to start `debugging <https://xkcd.com/1722/>`_, or *logging at a higher granularity* than is the default.
This allows you to gain more insights into the actions DataLad and its underlying tools are taking, where *exactly* they fail, and to even play around with the program at the state of the failure.

:term:`Debugging` and :term:`logging` are not as complex as these terms may sound if you have never consciously debugged.
Procedurally, it can be as easy as adding an additional flag to a command call, and cognitively, it can be as easy as engaging your visual system in a visual search task for the color red or the word "error", or reading more DataLad output that you're used to.
The paragraphs below start with the general concepts, and collect concrete debugging strategies for different problems. If you have advice to add, please `get in touch <https://github.com/datalad-handbook/book/issues>`__.

.. _logging:

Logging
"""""""

In order to gain more insights into the steps performed by a program and capture as many details as possible for troubleshooting an error, you can turn to :term:`logging`.
Logging simply refers to the fact that DataLad and its underlying tools tell you what they are doing:
This information can be coarse, such as a mere ``[INFO] Downloading <some_url> into <some_target>``, or fine-grained, such as ``[DEBUG] Resolved dataset for status reporting: <dataset>``.
The :term:`log level` in brackets at the beginning of the line indicates how many details DataLad shares with you.

Note that :term:`logging` is not a sealed book, and happens automatically during the execution of any DataLad command.
While you were reading the handbook, you have seen a lot of log messages already.
Anything printed to your terminal preceded by ``[INFO]``, for example, is a log message (in this case, on the ``info`` level).
When you are *consciously* logging, you simply set the log-level to the desired amount of information, or increase the amount of verbosity until the output gives you a hint of what went wrong.
Likewise, adjusting the log-level also works the other way around, and lets you *decrease* the amount of information you receive in your terminal.

.. find-out-more:: Log levels

   Log levels provide the means to adjust how much information you want, and are described in human readable terms, ordered by the severity of the failures or problems reported.
   The following log levels can be chosen from:

   - **critical**: Only catastrophes are reported. Currently, there is nothing inside of DataLad that would log at this level, so setting the log level to *critical* will result in getting no details at all, not even about errors or failures.
   - **error**: With this log level you will receive reports on any errors that occurred within the program during command execution.
   - **warning**: At this log level, the command execution will report on usual situations and anything that *might* be a problem, in addition to report anything from the *error* log level. .
   - **info**: This log level will include reports by the program that indicate normal behavior and serve to keep you up to date about the current state of things, in additions to warning and error logging messages.
   - **debug**: This log level is very useful to troubleshoot a problem, and results in DataLad telling you *a lot* it possibly can.

   Other than log *levels*, you can also adjust the amount of information provided with numerical granularity. Instead of specifying a log level, provide an integer between 1 and 9, with lower values denoting more debugging information.

   Raising the log level (e.g, to ``error``, or ``9``) will decrease the amount of information and output you will receive, while lowering it (e.g., to ``debug`` or ``1``) will increase it.



Setting a log level can be done in the form of an :term:`environment variable`, a configuration, or with the ``-l``/``--log-level`` flag appended directly after the main :command:`datalad` command.
To get extensive information on what :command:`datalad status` does underneath the hood, your command could look like this:

.. runrecord:: _examples/DL-101-135-105
   :language: console
   :workdir: dl-101/DataLad-101
   :lines: 1-15, 60-

   $ datalad --log-level debug status

.. find-out-more:: ... and how does it look when using environment variables or configurations?

   The log level can also be set (for different scopes) using the ``datalad.log.level`` configuration variable, or the corresponding environment variable ``DATALAD_LOG_LEVEL``.

   To set the log level for a single command, for example, set it in front of the command::

       $ DATALAD_LOG_LEVEL=debug datalad status

   And to set the log level for the rest of the shell session, export it::

       $ export DATALAD_LOG_LEVEL=debug
       $ datalad status
       $ ...

   You can find out a bit more on environment variable :ref:`in this Findoutmore <fom-envvar>`.

   The configuration variable can be used to set the log level on a user (global) or system-wide level with the :command:`git config` command::

      $ git config --global datalad.log.level debug

This output is extensive and detailed, but it precisely shows the sequence of commands and arguments that are run prior to a failure or crash, and all additional information that is reported with the log levels ``info`` or ``debug`` can be very helpful to find out what is wrong.
Even if the vast amount of detail in output generated with ``debug`` logging appears overwhelming, it can make sense to find out at which point an execution stalls, whether arguments, commands, or datasets reported in the debug output are what you expect them to be, and to forward all information into any potential GitHub issue you will be creating.

Finally, other than logging with a DataLad command, it sometimes can be useful to turn to :term:`git-annex` or :term:`Git` for logging.
For failing :command:`datalad get` calls, it may be useful to retry the retrieval using :command:`git annex get -d -v <file>`, where ``-d`` (debug) and ``-v`` (verbose) increase the amount of detail about the command execution and failure.
In rare cases where you suspect something might be wrong with Git, setting the environment variables ``GIT_TRACE`` and ``GIT_TRACE_SETUP`` to ``2`` prior to running a Git command will give you debugging output.

.. _debug:

Debugging
"""""""""

If the additional level of detail provided by logging messages is not enough, you can go further with actual :term:`debugging`.
For this, add the ``--dbg`` or ``--idbg`` flag to the main :command:`datalad` command, as in ``datalad --dbg status``.
Adding this flag will enter a `Python <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html>`_ or `IPython debugger <https://ipython.org/>`_ when something unexpectedly crashes.
This allows you to debug the program right when it fails, inspect available variables and their values, or step back and forth through the source code.
Note that debugging experience is not a prerequisite when using DataLad -- although it is `an exciting life skill <https://www.monkeyuser.com/2017/step-by-step-debugging/>`_.
`The official Python docs <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands>`_ provide a good overview on the available debugger commands if you are interested in learning more about this.

Debugging examples
""""""""""""""""""

This section collects errors and their solutions from real GitHub issues.
They may not be applicable for the problem you are currently facing, but seeing other's troubleshooting strategies may be helpful nevertheless.
If you are interested in getting your error and solution described here, please `get in touch <https://github.com/datalad-handbook/book/issues>`_.

:command:`datalad get`:
It is common for :command:`datalad get` errors to originate in :term:`git-annex`, the software used by DataLad to transfer data. Here are a few suggestions to debug them:

- Take a deep breath, or preferably a walk in a nice park :)
- Check that you are using a recent version of git-annex
   - ``git-annex version`` returns the version of git-annex on the first line of its input, and it is also reported in the output of :command:`datalad wtf`.
   - The version number contains the release date of the version in use. For instance, git-annex version: ``8.20200330-g971791563`` was released on 30 March 2020.
   - If the version that you are using is older than a few months, consider updating using the instructions `here <http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html>`_.
- Try to download the file using ``git-annex get -v -d <file_name>``. If this doesn't succeed, the DataLad command may not succeed. Options ``-d/--debug`` and ``-v`` are here to provide as much verbosity in error messages as possible
- Read the output of :term:`git-annex`, identify the error, breathe again, and solve the issue! :numref:`table-gitannex-errors` list a few common or tricky ones.

            [...]
            git-annex: get: 1 failed

     - MATLAB massively overrides the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` setting.
       This can lead to a number of issues, among them SSL certification errors.
       Prefixing the :command:`datalad get` command with

       .. code-block:: bash

          !LD_LIBRARY_PATH= datalad get [....]

       can solve this.

Common warnings and errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A lot of output you will see while working with DataLad originates from warnings
or errors by DataLad, git-annex, or Git.
Some of these outputs can be wordy and not trivial to comprehend - and even if
everything works, some warnings can be hard to understand.
This following section will list some common git-annex warnings and errors and
attempts to explain them. If you encounter warnings or errors that you would
like to see explained in this book, please let us know by
`filing an issue <https://github.com/datalad-handbook/book/issues/new>`_.

Output produced by Git
""""""""""""""""""""""

**Unset Git identity**

If you have not configured your Git identity, you will
see warnings like this when running any DataLad command::

   [WARNING] It is highly recommended to configure git first (set both user.name and user.email) before using DataLad.

To set your Git identity, go back to section :ref:`installconfig`.


**Rejected pushes**

One error you can run into when publishing dataset contents is that your
:command:`datalad push` to a sibling is rejected.
One example is this::

   $ datalad push --to public
    [ERROR  ] refs/heads/master->public:refs/heads/master [rejected] (non-fast-forward) [publish(/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101)]

This example is an attempt to push a local dataset to its sibling on GitHub. The
push is rejected because it is a ``non-fast-forward`` merge situation. Usually,
this means that the sibling contains changes that your local dataset does not yet
know about. It can be fixed by updating from the sibling first with a
:command:`datalad update --merge`.

.. _nonbarepush:

Here is a different push rejection::

   $ datalad push --to roommate
    publish(ok): . (dataset) [refs/heads/git-annex->roommate:refs/heads/git-annex 023a541..59a6f8d]
    [ERROR  ] refs/heads/master->roommate:refs/heads/master [remote rejected] (branch is currently checked out) [publish(/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101)]
    publish(error): . (dataset) [refs/heads/master->roommate:refs/heads/master [remote rejected] (branch is currently checked out)]
    action summary:
      publish (error: 1, ok: 1)

As you can see, the :term:`git-annex branch` was pushed successfully, but updating
the ``master`` branch was rejected: ``[remote rejected] (branch is currently checked out) [publish(/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101)]``.
In this particular case, this is because it was an attempt to push from ``DataLad-101``
to the ``roommate`` sibling that was created in chapter :ref:`chapter_collaboration`.
This is a special case of pushing, because it -- in technical terms -- is a push
to a non-bare repository. Unlike :term:`bare Git repositories`, non-bare
repositories can not be pushed to at all times. To fix this, you either want to
`checkout another branch <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout>`_
in the ``roommate`` sibling or push to a non-checked out branch in the ``roommate``
sibling. Alternatively, you can configure ``roommate`` to receive the push with
Git's ``receive.denyCurrentBranch`` configuration key. By default, this configuration
is set to ``refuse``. Setting it to ``updateInstead``
with ``git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead`` will allow updating
the checked out branch. See ``git config``\s
`man page entry <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-receivedenyCurrentBranch>`_
on ``receive.denyCurrentBranch`` for more.


**Detached HEADs**

One warning that you may encounter during an installation of a dataset is::

    [INFO   ] Submodule HEAD got detached. Resetting branch master to point to 046713bb. Original location was 47e53498

Even though "detached HEAD" sounds slightly worrisome, this is merely an information
and does not require an action from your side. It is related to
`Git submodules <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_ (the underlying
Git concept for subdatasets), and informs you about the current state a
subdataset is saved in the superdataset you have just cloned.

Output produced by git-annex
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Unusable annexes**

Upon installation of a dataset, you may see::

   [INFO    ]     Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore
   [INFO    ]     This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the
   remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you
   ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation,
   run: git annex enableremote origin

This warning lets you know that git-annex will not attempt to download
content from the :term:`remote` "origin". This can have
many reasons, but as long as there are other remotes you can access the
data from, you are fine.

A similar warning message may appear when adding a sibling that is a pure Git
:term:`remote`, for example a repository on GitHub::

   [INFO ] Failed to enable annex remote github, could be a pure git or not
   accessible
   [WARNING] Failed to determine if github carries annex. Remote was marked by
   annex as annex-ignore. Edit .git/config to reset if you think that was done
   by mistake due to absent connection etc

These messages indicate that the sibling ``github`` does not carry an annex.
Thus, annexed file contents can not be pushed to this sibling. This happens
if the sibling indeed does not have an annex (which would be true, for example,
for siblings on :term:`GitHub`, :term:`GitLab`, :term:`Bitbucket`, ..., and
would not require any further action or worry), or
if the remote could not be reached, e.g., due to a missing internet
connection (in which case you could set the key ``annex-ignore`` in
``.git/config`` to ``false``).

Speaking of remotes that are not available, this will probably be one of the most
commonly occurring git-annex errors to see - failing :command:`datalad get` calls
because remotes are not available:

Other errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, registered subdatasets URLs have an :term:`SSH` instead of :term:`https` address, for example ``git@github.com:datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git`` instead of ``https://github.com/datalad-datasets/longnow-podcasts.git``.
If one does not have an SSH key configured for the required service (e.g., GitHub, or a server), installing or getting the subdataset and its contents fails, with messages starting similar to this::

   [INFO   ] Cloning https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/paper-remodnav.git/remodnav [2 other candidates] into '/home/homeGlobal/adina/paper-remodnav/remodnav'
   Permission denied (publickey).

If you encounter these errors, make sure to create and/or upload an SSH key (see section :ref:`Gin` for an example) as necessary, or reconfigure/edit the URL into a HTTPS URL.


**git-annex as the default branch on GitHub**

If you publish a dataset to :term:`GitHub`, but the resulting repository seems to consist of cryptic directories instead of your actual file names and directories, GitHub may have made the :term:`git-annex branch` the default.

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/defaultgitannex.png

To find out more about this and how to fix it, please take a look at the corresponding :ref:`FAQ <gitannexdefault>`.

**Windows adds whitespace line-endings to unchanged files**

The type of line ending (a typically invisible character that indicates a line break) differs between operating system.
While Linux and OSX use a *line feed* (LF), Windows uses *carriage return* + *line feed* (CRLF).
When you only collaborate across operating systems of the same type, this is a very boring fun fact at most.
But if Windows- and Non-Windows users collaborate, or if you are working with files across different operating systems, the different type of line ending that Windows uses may show up as unintended modifications on other system.
In most cases, this is prevented by a default cross-platform compatible line-ending configuration on Windows that is set during installation:

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/crlf.png

To fix this behavior outside of the installation process and standardize line endings across operating systems, Windows users are advised to set the configuration ``core.autcrlf true`` with ``git config --global core.autocrfl true``.

asyncio errors at DataLad import
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

DataLad's internal command runner uses `asyncio
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_. This can lead to
an error when DataLad is used within a script or application that
itself uses asyncio. To summarize the problem with a `quote from
Python's bug tracker <https://bugs.python.org/issue33523#msg349561>`_:
"you can't call async code from sync code that's being called from
async code".

Jupyter Notebooks are probably the most likely place that you'll run
into this error (`ipykernel issue 548
<https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/issues/548>`_). When importing
``datalad``, you'll see this:

.. code-block:: bash

   RuntimeError: Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running

The `nest-asyncio <https://pypi.org/project/nest-asyncio/>`_ package
provides a workaround:

.. code-block:: bash

   >>> import nest_asyncio
   >>> nest_asyncio.apply()

   >>> import datalad





.. todo::

    paste some "please make these remotes available output"





.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] ``wtf`` in :command:`datalad wtf` could stand for many things. "Why the Face?"
