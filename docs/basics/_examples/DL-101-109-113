The datalad run command can record the impact a script or command has
on a Dataset. In its simplest form, datalad run only takes a commit
message and the command that should be executed.

Any datalad run command can be re-executed by using its commit shasum
as an argument in datalad rerun CHECKSUM. DataLad will take
information from the run record of the original commit, and re-execute
it. If no changes happen with a rerun, the command will not be written
to history. Note: you can also rerun a datalad rerun command!
