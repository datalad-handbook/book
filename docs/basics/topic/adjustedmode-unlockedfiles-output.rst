Given that nothing in your dataset is locked, is there a *need* for you to bother with creating ``--output`` flags?
Not for you personally, if you only stay on your Windows machine.
However, you will be doing others that you share your dataset with a favor if they are not using Windows -- should you or others want to rerun a run record, ``--output`` flags will make it work on all operating systems.
