Redirection
-----------

This page exists for redirection purposes only.

..
   Include a named paragraph in the page, where the javascript code below will
   place any message.

.. raw:: html

   <p><strong id="successmessage">
     You will be redirected to your target page in a few seconds.
   </strong></p>

..
   use a custom role to identify redirect codes so that a bit of JS can find
   them again

.. role:: redirect
   :class: redirect

If you continue to see this page, you've ended up in here accidentally and redirection

   This code replaces the r.html?key part with the final URL, while keeping
   the rest of URL intact.

.. raw:: html

   <script>
   // take everything after "?" as a code to identify the redirect. If there is a '=' appended (a glitch that started to surface Dec 2022), remove it and everything afterwards
   redirect_code = window.location.href.replace(/.*\?/, "").replace(/=.*/, "");
   success = false;
   // loop over all redirect definitions (see above)
   for (rd of document.getElementsByClassName('redirect')){
     if (rd.innerText != redirect_code) {continue;}
     // read the href from the link in the <dd> matching the <dt> of the redirect
     // this assumes a very simple, and particular structure
     // let's hope that sphinx doesn't break it
     target = rd.parentElement.nextElementSibling.getElementsByTagName("a")[0].href;
     // and jump
     window.location.replace(target);
     success = true;
     break;
   }
   // if we get here, we didn't find a match
   if (success == false) {
     document.getElementById("successmessage"
       ).innerHTML = "Whoops - redirection went wrong, we are lost!"
   }
