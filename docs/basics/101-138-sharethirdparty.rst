Beyond shared infrastructure
----------------------------

.. admonition:: There can never be "too much" documentation

   If you plan to share your own datasets with people that are unfamiliar with
   DataLad, it may be helpful to give a short explanation of what a DataLad
   dataset is and what it can do. For this, you can use a ready-made text
   block that the handbook provides. To find this textblock, go to
   :ref:`dataset_textblock`

From the sections :ref:`sharelocal1` and :ref:`yoda_project` you already
know about two common setups for sharing datasets:

Users on a common, shared computational infrastructure such as an :term:`SSH server`
can share datasets via simple installations with paths.

Without access to the same computer, it is possible to :command:`push` datasets
to :term:`GitHub` or :term:`GitLab` to publish them.
You have already done this when you shared
your ``midterm_project`` dataset via :term:`GitHub`. However, this section
demonstrated that the files stored in :term:`git-annex` (such as the results of
your analysis, ``pairwise_comparisons.png`` and ``prediction_report.csv``) are not
published to GitHub: There was meta data about their file availability, but a
:command:`datalad get` command on these files failed, because storing (large)
annexed content is currently not supported by :term:`GitHub` [#f1]_.
In the case of the ``midterm_project``, this was not a problem: The
computations that you ran were captured with :command:`datalad run`, and
others can just recompute your results instead of :command:`datalad get`\ting them.

However, not always do two or more parties share the same server, have access to
the same systems, or share something that can be recomputed quickly, but need to
actually share datasets with data, including the annexed contents.

Leveraging third party infrastructure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's say you'd like to share your complete ``DataLad-101`` dataset with
a friend overseas. After all you know about DataLad, you'd like to let more people
know about its capabilities. You and your friend, however, do not have access
to the same computational infrastructure, and there are also many annexed files, e.g.,
the PDFs in your dataset, that you'd like your friend to have but that can't be
simply computed or automatically obtained from web sources.

In these cases, the two previous approaches to share data do not suffice.
What you would like to do is to provide your friend with a GitHub URL to
install a dataset from *and* successfully run :command:`datalad get`, just as with
the many publicly available DataLad datasets such as the ``longnow`` podcasts.

To share all dataset contents with your friend, you need to configure an external
resource that stores your annexed data contents and that can be accessed by the
person you want to share your data with. Such a resource can be a private
web server, but also a third party services cloud storage such as
`Dropbox <https://dropbox.com>`_,
`Google <https://google.com>`_,
`Amazon S3 buckets <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls>`_,
`Box.com <https://www.box.com/en-gb/home>`_,
`Figshare <https://figshare.com/>`__,
`owncloud <https://owncloud.org/>`_,
`sciebo <https://sciebo.de/>`_,
the `Open Science Framework (OSF) <https://osf.io/>`__  (requires the `datalad-osf extension <http://docs.datalad.org/projects/osf/en/latest/index.html>`_),
or many more. The key to achieve this lies within :term:`git-annex`.

In order to use third party services for file storage, you need to configure the
service of your choice and *publish* the annexed contents to it. Afterwards,
the published dataset (e.g., via :term:`GitHub` or :term:`GitLab`) stores the
information about where to obtain annexed file contents from such that
:command:`datalad get` works.

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/publishing/publishing_network_publishparts2.svg

This tutorial showcases how this can be done, and shows the basics of how
datasets can be shared via a third party infrastructure.

.. note::

   There are two easier and free alternatives to what is outlined in this section:

   - Using the free G-Node Infrastructure :term:`Gin`, a repository hosting service with support for dataset annexes.
     The :ref:`next section <gin>` introduces how to use this third party infrastructure, and you can skip ahead if you prefer an easier start.

   - Using the ``datalad-osf`` extension to publish datasets and their file contents to the free `Open Science Framework (OSF) <https://osf.io/>`__.
     This alternative differs from what is outlined in this chapter, but its `documentation <http://docs.datalad.org/projects/osf/en/latest/index.html>`_ provides detailed tutorials and use cases.

   If you are interested in learning how to set up a special remote, or are bound to a different third party provider than :term:`Gin` or the OSF, please read on in this section.

From your perspective (as someone who wants to share data), you will
need to

- (potentially) install/setup the relevant *special-remote*,
- find a place that large file content can be stored in & set up a
  *publication dependency* on this location,
- publish your dataset

This gives you the freedom to decide where your data lives and
who can have access to it. Once this set up is complete, updating and
accessing a published dataset and its data is almost as easy as if it would
lie on your own machine.

From the perspective of your friend (as someone who wants to obtain a dataset),
they will need to

- (potentially) install the relevant *special-remote* and
- perform the standard :command:`datalad clone` and :command:`datalad get` commands
  as necessary.

Thus, from a collaborator's perspective, with the exception of potentially
installing/setting up the relevant *special-remote*, obtaining your dataset and its
data is as easy as with any public DataLad dataset.
While you have to invest some setup effort in the beginning, once this
is done, the workflows of yours and others are the same that you are already
very familiar with.

Setting up 3rd party services to host your data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   The tutorial below is functional, but there is work towards a wrapper
   function to ease creating and working with rclone-based special remotes:
   https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4162.
   Once finished, this section will be updated accordingly.

In this paragraph you will see how a third party service can be configured
to host your data. Note that the *exact* procedures are different from service
to service -- this is inconvenient, but inevitable given the
differences between the various third party infrastructures.
The general workflow, however, is the same:

#. Initialize the appropriate Git-annex *special-remote* (different
   from service to service).
#. Push annexed file content to the third-party service to use it as a storage provider
#. Share the dataset (repository) via GitHub/GitLab/... for others to install from

If the above steps are implemented, others can :command:`install` or
:command:`clone` your shared dataset, and :command:`get` or :command:`pull` large
file content from the remote, third party storage.

.. findoutmore:: What is a special remote

   A special-remote is an extension to Git’s concept of remotes, and can
   enable :term:`git-annex` to transfer data from and possibly to places that are not Git
   repositories (e.g., cloud services or external machines such as an HPC
   system). For example, *s3* special remote uploads and downloads content
   to AWS S3, *web* special remote downloads files from the web, *datalad-archive*
   extracts files from the annexed archives, etc. Don’t envision a special-remote
   as merely a physical place or location – a special-remote is a protocol that
   defines the underlying transport of your files to and/or from a specific location.

As an example, let's walk through all necessary steps to publish ``DataLad-101``
to **Dropbox**. If you instead are interested in learning how to set up a public
`Amazon S3 bucket <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls>`_, there is a single-page, step-by-step
walk-through `in the documentation of git-annex <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/public_Amazon_S3_remote/>`_
that shows how you can create an S3 special remote and share data with anyone who
gets a clone of your dataset, without them needing Amazon AWS credentials. Likewise,
the documentation provides step-by-step walk-throughs for many other services,
such as `Google Cloud Storage <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/using_Google_Cloud_Storage/>`_,
`Box.com <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/using_box.com_as_a_special_remote/>`__,
`Amazon Glacier <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/using_Amazon_Glacier/>`_,
`OwnCloud <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/owncloudannex/>`__, and many more.
Here is the complete list: `git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/ <https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/>`_.

For Dropbox, the relevant special-remote to configures is
`rclone <https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone>`__.
It is a command line program to sync files and directories to and
from a large number of commercial providers [#f2]_ (Amazon Cloud Drive, Microsoft
One Drive, ...). By enabling it as a special remote, :term:`git-annex` gets the
ability to do the same, and can thus take care of publishing large file content
to such sources conveniently under the hood.


- The first step is to `install <https://rclone.org/install/>`_
  ``rclone`` on your computer. The installation instructions are straightforward
  and the installation is quick if you are on a Unix-based system (macOS or any
  Linux distribution).

- Afterwards, run ``rclone config`` from the command line to configure ``rclone`` to
  work with Dropbox. Running this command will a guide you with an interactive
  prompt through a ~2 minute configuration of the remote (here we will name the
  remote "dropbox-for-friends" -- the name will be used to refer to it later during the
  configuration of the dataset we want to publish). The interactive dialog is
  outlined below, and all parts that require user input are highlighted.

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 7-8, 22, 26, 30, 36

   $ rclone config

    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...

- At this point, this will open a browser and ask you to authorize ``rclone`` to
  manage your Dropbox, or any other third-party service you have selected
  in the interactive prompt. Accepting will bring you back into the terminal
  to the final configuration prompts:

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 12, 26

   type = dropbox
   token = {"access_token":"meVHyc[...]",
            "token_type":"bearer",

   d) Delete remote
   r) Rename remote
   c) Copy remote
   s) Set configuration password
   q) Quit config
   e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

- Once this is done, install ``git-annex-remote-rclone``.
  It is a wrapper around `rclone <https://rclone.or>`__ that makes any   destination supported by rclone usable with :term:`git-annex`.
  If you are on a recent version of Debian or Ubuntu (or enable `NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.org>`_ repository), you can get it conveniently via your package manager, e.g., with ``sudo apt-get install git-annex-remote-rclone``.
  Alternatively, ``git clone`` the `git-annex-remote-rclone <https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone>`_ repository to your machine (do not clone it into ``DataLad-101`` but somewhere else on your computer)::

     $ git clone https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone.git

- Copy the path to this repository into your ``$PATH`` variable. If the
  clone is in ``/home/user-bob/repos``, the command would look like this [#f3]_::

   $ export PATH="/home/user-bob/repos/git-annex-remote-rclone:$PATH"

- Finally, in the dataset you want to share, run the :command:`git annex initremote` command.
  Give the remote a name (it is ``dropbox-for-friends`` here), and specify the name of  the remote you configured with ``rclone`` with the ``target`` parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git annex initremote dropbox-for-friends type=external externaltype=rclone chunk=50MiB encryption=none target=dropbox-for-friends prefix=my_awesome_dataset

   initremote dropbox-for-friends ok
   (recording state in git...)

What has happened up to this point is that we have configured Dropbox
as a third-party storage service for the annexed contents in the dataset.
On a conceptual, dataset level, your Dropbox folder is now a :term:`sibling` -- the sibling name is the first positional argument after ``initremote``, i.e., "dropbox-for-friends":

.. code-block:: bash

   $ datalad siblings
    .: here(+) [git]
    .: dropbox-for-friends(+) [rclone]
    .: roommate(+) [../mock_user/DataLad-101 (git)]

On Dropbox, a new folder will be created for your annexed files.
By default, this folder will be called ``git-annex``, but it can be configured using the ``--prefix=<whatitshouldbecalled>`` option, as done above.
However, this directory on Dropbox is not the location you would refer your friend or a collaborator to.
The representation of the files in the special-remote is not human-readable --
it is a tree of annex objects, and thus looks like a bunch of very weirdly named
folders and files to anyone.
Through this design it becomes possible to chunk files into smaller units (see
`the git-annex documentation <https://git-annex.branchable.com/chunking/>`_ for more on this),
optionally encrypt content on its way from a local machine to a storage service
(see `the git-annex documentation <https://git-annex.branchable.com/encryption/>`__ for more on this),
and avoid leakage of information via file names. Therefore, the Dropbox remote is
not a places a real person would take a look at, instead they are only meant to
be managed and accessed via DataLad/git-annex.

To actually share your dataset with someone, you need to *publish* it to Github,
Gitlab, or a similar hosting service.

You could, for example, create a sibling of the ``DataLad-101`` dataset
on GitHub with the command :command:`datalad-sibling-github`.
This will create a new GitHub repository called "DataLad-101" under your account,
and configure this repository as a :term:`sibling` of your dataset
called ``github`` (exactly like you have done in :ref:`yoda_project`
with the ``midterm_project`` subdataset).
However, in order to be able to link the contents stored in Dropbox, you also need to
configure a *publication dependency* to the ``dropbox-for-friends`` sibling -- this is
done with the ``publish-depends <sibling>`` option.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ datalad create-sibling-github -d . DataLad-101 --publish-depends dropbox-for-friends
     [INFO   ] Configure additional publication dependency on "dropbox-for-friends"
     .: github(-) [https://github.com/<user-name>/DataLad-101.git (git)]
     'https://github.com/<user-name>/DataLad-101.git' configured as sibling 'github' for <Dataset path=/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101>

:command:`datalad siblings` will again list all available siblings:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ datalad siblings
    .: here(+) [git]
    .: dropbox-for-friends(+) [rclone]
    .: roommate(+) [../mock_user/DataLad-101 (git)]
    .: github(-) [https://github.com/<user-name>/DataLad-101.git (git)]

Note that each sibling has either a ``+`` or ``-`` attached to its name. This
indicates the presence (``+``) or absence (``-``) of a remote data annex at this
remote. You can see that your ``github`` sibling indeed does not have a remote
data annex.
Therefore, instead of "only" publishing to this GitHub repository (as done in section
:ref:`yoda_project`), in order to also publish annex contents, we made
publishing to GitHub dependent on the ``dropbox-for-friends`` sibling
(that has a remote data annex), so that annexed contents are published
there first.

.. note::

   Note that the publication dependency is only established for your own dataset,
   it is not shared with clones of the dataset. Internally, this configuration
   is a key value pair in the section of your remote in ``.git/config``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      [remote "github"]
         annex-ignore = true
         url = https://github.com/<user-name>/DataLad-101.git
         fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*
         datalad-publish-depends = dropbox-for-friends

With this setup, we can publish the dataset to GitHub. Note how the publication
dependency is served first:

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   $ datalad push --to github
   [INFO   ] Transferring data to configured publication dependency: 'dropbox-for-friends'
   [INFO   ] Publishing <Dataset path=/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101> data to dropbox-for-friends
   publish(ok): books/TLCL.pdf (file)
   publish(ok): books/byte-of-python.pdf (file)
   publish(ok): books/progit.pdf (file)
   publish(ok): recordings/interval_logo_small.jpg (file)
   publish(ok): recordings/salt_logo_small.jpg (file)
   [INFO   ] Publishing to configured dependency: 'dropbox-for-friends'
   [INFO   ] Publishing <Dataset path=/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101> data to dropbox-for-friends
   [INFO   ] Publishing <Dataset path=/home/me/dl-101/DataLad-101> to github
   Username for 'https://github.com': <user-name>
   Password for 'https://<user-name>@github.com':
   publish(ok): . (dataset) [pushed to github: ['[new branch]', '[new branch]']]
   action summary:
     publish (ok: 6)


Afterwards, your dataset can be found on GitHub, and ``cloned`` or ``installed``.

The option ``--transfer-data`` determines how publishing annexed contents should
be handled. With the option ``all``, *all* annexed contents are published to the
third-party data storage.
``--transfer-data none``, however, only publishes information stored in Git --
that is: The symlink, as information about file availability, but no file
content. Anyone who attempts to :command:`datalad get` a file from a dataset clone
if its contents were not published will fail.


.. findoutmore:: What if I do not want to share a dataset with everyone, or only some files of it?

   There are a number of ways to restrict access to your dataset or individual
   files of your dataset. One is via choice of (third party) hosting service
   for annexed file contents.
   If you chose a service only selected people have access to, and publish annexed
   contents exclusively there, then only those selected people can perform a
   successful :command:`datalad get`. On shared file systems you may achieve
   this via :term:`permissions` for certain groups or users, and for third party
   infrastructure you may achieve this by invitations/permissions/... options
   of the respective service.

   If it is individual files that you do not want to share, you can selectively
   publish the contents of all files you want others to have, and withhold the data
   of the files you do not want to share. This can be done by providing paths
   to the data that should be published, and the ``--transfer-data auto`` option.

   Let's say you have a dataset with three files:

   - ``experiment.txt``
   - ``subject_1.dat``
   - ``subject_2.data``

   Consider that all of these files are annexed. While the information in
   ``experiment.txt`` is fine for everyone to see, ``subject_1.dat`` and
   ``subject_2.dat`` contain personal and potentially identifying data that
   can not be shared. Nevertheless, you want collaborators to know that these
   files exist. The use case

   .. todo::

      Write use case "external researcher without data access"

   details such a scenario and demonstrates how external collaborators (with whom data
   can not be shared) can develop scripts against the directory structure and
   file names of a dataset, submit those scripts to the data owners, and thus still perform an
   analysis despite not having access to the data.

   By publishing only the file contents of ``experiment.txt`` with

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ datalad publish --to github --transfer-data auto experiment.txt

   only meta data about file availability of ``subject_1.dat`` and ``subject_2.dat``
   exists, but as these files' annexed data is not published, a :command:`datalad get`
   will fail. Note, though, that :command:`publish` will publish the complete
   dataset history (unless you specify a commit range with the ``--since`` option
   -- see the `manual <http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-publish.html>`_
   for more information).


From the perspective of whom you share your dataset with...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your friend would now want to get your dataset including the annexed
contents, and you made sure that they can access the Dropbox folder with
the annexed files (e.g., by sharing an access link), here is what they would
have to do:

If the repository is on GitHub, a :command:`datalad clone` with the URL
will install the dataset::

   $ datalad clone https://github.com/<user-name>/DataLad-101.git
   [INFO   ] Cloning https://github.com/<user-name>/DataLad-101.git [1 other candidates] into '/Users/awagner/Documents/DataLad-101'
   [INFO   ]   Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore
   [INFO   ] access to 1 dataset sibling dropbox-for-friends not auto-enabled, enable with:
   |         datalad siblings -d "/Users/awagner/Documents/DataLad-101" enable -s dropbox-for-friends
   install(ok): /Users/awagner/Documents/DataLad-101 (dataset)

Pay attention to one crucial information in this output::

   [INFO   ] access to 1 dataset sibling dropbox-for-friends not auto-enabled, enable with:
   |         datalad siblings -d "/Users/<user-name>/Documents/DataLad-101" enable -s dropbox-for-friends

This means that someone who wants to access the data from dropbox needs to
enable the special remote.
For this,  this person first needs to install and configure ``rclone``
as well: Since ``rclone`` is the protocol with which
annexed data can be transferred from and to Dropbox, anyone who needs annexed
data from Dropbox needs *this* special remote. Therefore, the first steps are
the same as before:

- `Install <https://rclone.org/install/>`__ ``rclone`` (as described above).
- Run ``rclone config`` to configure ``rclone`` to work with Dropbox (as described above). **It is important to name the remote identically** - in the example above, it would need to be "dropbox-for-friends".
  This means: You need to communicate the name of your special remote to your friend, and they have to give it the same name as the one configured in the dataset).
  (There are efforts towards extracting this information automatically from datasets, but for the time being, this is an important detail to keep in mind).
- install `git-annex-remote-rclone <https://github.com/DanielDent/git-annex-remote-rclone>`_ (as described above).

After this is done, you can execute what DataLad's output message suggests
to "enable" this special remote (inside of the installed ``DataLad-101``)::

   $ datalad siblings -d "/Users/awagner/Documents/DataLad-101" enable -s dropbox-for-friends
   .: dropbox-for-friends(?) [git]

And once this is done, you can get any annexed file contents, for example the
books, or the cropped logos from chapter :ref:`chapter_run`::

   $ datalad get books/TLCL.pdf
   get(ok): /home/some/other/user/DataLad-101/books/TLCL.pdf (file) [from dropbox-for-friends]

.. _gitlfs:

Use GitHub for sharing content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GitHub supports `Git Large File Storage <https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs>`_
(Git LFS) for managing data files using Git.  Free GitHub subscription allows up
to `1GB of free storage and up to 1GB of bandwidth monthly <https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage>`_.
As such, it might be sufficient for some use cases, and could be configured
quite easily.  Similarly to the steps above, we need first to create a repository
on GitHub if it does not already exist::

    $ datalad create-sibling-github test-github-lfs
    .: github(-) [https://github.com/yarikoptic/test-github-lfs.git (git)]
    'https://github.com/yarikoptic/test-github-lfs.git' configured as sibling 'github' for <Dataset path=/tmp/test-github-lfs>

and then initialize special remote of type ``git-lfs``, pointing to the same GitHub
repository::

    $ git annex initremote github-lfs type=git-lfs url=https://github.com/yarikoptic/test-github-lfs encryption=none embedcreds=no

If you would like to compress data in Git LFS, you need to take a detour via
encryption during :command:`git annex initremote` -- this has compression as a
convenient side effect. Here is an example initialization::

   $ git annex initremote --force github-lfs type=git-lfs url=https://github.com/yarikoptic/test-github-lfs encryption=shared

With this single step it becomes possible to transfer contents to GitHub::

    $ git annex copy --to=github-lfs file.dat
    copy file.dat (to github-lfs...)
    ok
    (recording state in git...)

and the entire dataset to the same GitHub repository::

    $ datalad push --to=github
    [INFO   ] Publishing <Dataset path=/tmp/test-github-lfs> to github
    publish(ok): . (dataset) [pushed to github: ['[new branch]', '[new branch]']]

Because the special remote URL coincides with the regular remote URL on GitHub,
``siblings enable`` will not even be necessary when datalad is installed
from GitHub.

.. note::

   Unfortunately, it is impossible to :command:`drop` contents from Git LFS:
   `help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files <https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/removing-files-from-git-large-file-storage#git-lfs-objects-in-your-repository>`_

.. _figshare:

Built-in data export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apart from flexibly configurable special remotes that allow publishing
annexed content to a variety of third party infrastructure, DataLad also has
some build-in support for "exporting" data to other services.

One example is the command :command:`export-archive`. Running
this command would produce a ``.tar.gz`` file with the content of your dataset,
which you could later upload to any data hosting portal manually. This moves
data out of version control and decentralized tracking,
and essentially "throws it over the wall". This means, while your data (also
the annexed data) will be available for download from where you share it, none of the
special features a DataLad dataset provides will be available, such as its
history or configurations.

Another example is :command:`export-to-figshare`. Running this command allows
you to publish the dataset to `Figshare <https://figshare.com/>`__.  As the
:command:`export-archive` is used by it to prepare content for upload to
Figshare, annexed files also will be annotated as available from the archive on
Figshare using ``datalad-archive`` special remote.  As a result, if you publish
your Figshare dataset and share your DataLad dataset on GitHub, users will still
be able to fetch content from the tarball shared on Figshare via DataLad.

.. [#f1] :term:`GitLab`, on the other hand, provides a git-annex configuration. It
         is disabled by default, and to enable it you would need to have administrative
         access to the server and client side of your GitLab instance. Find out more
         `here <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/git_annex.html>`_.
         Alternatively, GitHub can integrate with
         `GitLFS <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`__, a non-free, centralized service
         that allows to store large file contents. The last paragraph in this
         section shows an example on how to use their free trial version.

.. [#f2] ``rclone`` is a useful special-remote for this example, because
         you can not only use it for Dropbox, but also for many other
         third-party hosting services.
         For a complete overview of which third-party services are
         available and which special-remote they need, please see this
         `list <http://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/>`_.

.. [#f3] Note that ``export`` will extend your ``$PATH`` *for your current shell*.
         This means you will have to repeat this command if you open a new shell.
         Alternatively, you can insert this line into your shells configuration file
         (e.g., ``~/.bashrc``) to make this path available to all future shells of
         your user account.
