Walk-through: Amazon S3 as a special remote
-------------------------------------------

.. importantnote:: This walk-through requires git-annex >= 10.20230802

   Prior versions of git-annex do not support public access via the ``publicurl`` parameter with S3 buckets created after April 2023.
   Find out more about this in `this discussion <https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/S3_ACL_deprecation/>`_.


`Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3>`_ (or Amazon Simple Storage Service) is a
popular service by `Amazon Web Services <https://aws.amazon.com>`_ (AWS) that
provides object storage through a web service interface. An S3 bucket can be 
configured as a :term:`git-annex` :term:`special remote`, allowing it to be used
as a DataLad publication target. This means that you can use Amazon S3 to store your
annexed data contents and allow users to install your full dataset with DataLad
from a publicly available repository service such as GitHub.

In this section, we provide a walkthrough on how to set up Amazon S3 for hosting
your DataLad dataset, and how to access this data locally from GitHub.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to use Amazon S3 for hosting your datasets, and to follow the steps below, you need to:

- Signup for an `AWS account <https://aws.amazon.com>`_
- Verify your account
- Find your AWS access key
- Signup for a `GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`_
- Install `wget <https://www.gnu.org/software/wget>`_ in order to download sample data
- Optional: install the `AWS Command Line Interface <https://aws.amazon.com/cli>`_

The `AWS signup <https://aws.amazon.com>`_ procedure requires you to provide your
e-mail address, physical address, and credit card details before verification is possible. 

.. importantnote:: AWS account usage can incur costs

   While Amazon provides `Free Tier <https://aws.amazon.com/free>`_ access to its services,
   it can still potentially result in costs if usage exceeds `Free Tier Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-limits.html>`_.
   Be sure to take note of these limits, or set up `automatic tracking alerts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/tracking-free-tier-usage.html>`_
   to be notified before incurring unnecessary costs.


To find your AWS access key, log in to the `AWS Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com>`_,
open the dropdown menu at your username (top right), and select "My Security
Credentials". A new page will open with several options, including "Access keys
(access key ID and secret access key)" from where you can select "Create New Access
Key" or access existing credentials. Take note to copy both the "Access Key ID" and
"Secret Access Key".

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/aws_s3_create_access_key.png

   Create a new AWS access key from "My Security Credentials"

To ensure that your access key details are known when initializing the special
remote, export them as :term:`environment variable`\s in your shell:

.. code-block:: console

   $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-ID"
   $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"

In order to work directly with AWS via your command-line shell, you can
`install the AWS CLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html>`_.
However, that is not required for this walkthrough.

Lastly, to publish your data repository to GitHub, from which users will be able do install
the complete dataset, you will need a `GitHub account <https://github.com/join>`_.

Your DataLad dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you already have a small DataLad dataset to practice with, feel free to use it
during the rest of the walkthrough. If you do not have data, no problem! As a general
introduction, the steps below will download a small public neuroimaging dataset,
and transform it into a DataLad dataset. We'll use the `MoAEpilot <https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/auditory>`_
dataset containing anatomical and functional images from a single brain, as well as some metadata.

In the first step, we create a new directory called ``neuro-data-s3``, we download and extract the data,
and then we move the extracted contents into our new directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd <wherever-you-want-to-create-the-dataset>
   $ mkdir neuro-data-s3 && \
   wget https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/data/MoAEpilot/MoAEpilot.bids.zip -O neuro-data-s3.zip && \
   unzip neuro-data-s3.zip -d neuro-data-s3 && \
   rm neuro-data-s3.zip && \
   cd neuro-data-s3 && \
   mv MoAEpilot/* . && \
   rm -R MoAEpilot

      creating: neuro-data-s3/MoAEpilot/sub-01/anat/
   inflating: neuro-data-s3/MoAEpilot/sub-01/anat/sub-01_T1w.nii

Now we can view the directory tree to see the dataset content:

.. code-block:: console

   $ tree
   .
   ├── CHANGES
   ├── README
   ├── dataset_description.json
   ├── sub-01
   │   ├── anat
   │   │   └── sub-01_T1w.nii
   │   └── func
   │       ├── sub-01_task-auditory_bold.nii
   │       └── sub-01_task-auditory_events.tsv
   └── task-auditory_bold.json

The next step is to ensure that this is a valid DataLad dataset,
with ``main`` as the default branch.

We can turn our ``neuro-data-s3`` directory into a DataLad dataset with the
:dlcmd:`create --force` command. After that, we save the dataset with :dlcmd:`save`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ datalad create --force --description "neuro data to host on s3"
   [INFO   ] Creating a new annex repo at /Users/jsheunis/Documents/neuro-data-s3
   [INFO   ] Scanning for unlocked files (this may take some time)
   create(ok): /Users/jsheunis/Documents/neuro-data-s3 (dataset)

   $ datalad save -m "Add public data"
   add(ok): CHANGES (file)
   add(ok): README (file)

   add(ok): task-auditory_bold.json (file)
   save(ok): . (dataset)
   action summary:
   add (ok: 7)
   save (ok: 1)

Initialize the S3 special remote
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The steps below have been adapted from instructions provided on `git-annex documentation <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/public_Amazon_S3_remote>`_.
For more info on the S3 special remote, see `the s3 special remote manpage <https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/S3>`.

By initializing the special remote, what actually happens in the background
is that a :term:`sibling` is added to the DataLad dataset. This can be verified
by running :dlcmd:`siblings` before and after initializing the special
remote. Before, the only "sibling" is the actual DataLad dataset:

.. code-block:: console

   $ datalad siblings
   .: here(+) [git]

To initialize a public S3 bucket as a special remote, we run :gitannexcmd:`initremote`
with several options, for which `git-annex documentation on S3 <https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/S3>`_
provides detailed information. Be sure to select a unique bucket name
that adheres to Amazon S3's `bucket naming rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html>`_.
You can declare the bucket name (in this example "sample-neurodata-public") as a variable since
it will be used again later.

.. code-block:: console

   $ BUCKET=sample-neurodata-public
   $ git annex initremote public-s3 type=S3 encryption=none \
   bucket=$BUCKET datacenter=EU autoenable=true
   initremote public-s3 (checking bucket...) (creating bucket in EU...) ok
   (recording state in git...)

The options used in this example include:

- ``public-s3``: the name we select for our special remote, so that git-annex and DataLad can identify it
- ``type=S3``: the type of special remote (git-annex can work with many `special remote types <https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes>`_)
- ``encryption=none``: no encryption (alternatively enable ``encryption=shared``, meaning files will be encrypted on S3, and anyone with a clone of the git repository will be able to download and decrypt them)
- ``bucket=$BUCKET``: the name of the bucket to be created on S3 (using the declared variable)
- ``datacenter=EU``: specify where the data will be located; here we set "EU" which is EU/Ireland a.k.a. ``eu-west-1`` (defaults to "US" if not specified)
- ``autoenable=true``: git-annex will attempt to enable the special remote when it is run in a new clone, implying that users won't have to run extra steps when installing the dataset with DataLad

After :gitannexcmd:`initremote` has successfully initialized the special remote,
you can run :dlcmd:`siblings` to see that a sibling has been added:

.. code-block:: console

   $ datalad siblings
   .: here(+) [git]
   .: public-s3(+) [git]

You can also visit the `S3 Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3>`_ and navigate
to "Buckets" to see your newly created bucket. It should only have a single 
``annex-uuid`` file as content, since no actual file content has been pushed yet.

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/aws_s3_bucket_empty.png

   A newly created public S3 bucket

By default, this bucket and its contents are not publicly accessible.
To make them public, switch to the "Permissions" tab in your buckets S3 console overview, and turn the option "Block all public access" off (see :ref:`s3_terraform` for how to do this using terraform).

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/aws_s3_bucket_permissions.png

   Bucket settings allow making the bucket public

Alternatively, create a bucket policy as shown below, inserting your own bucket name into the two placeholders::

    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE",
                "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE/*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/aws_s3_bucket_policy.png

   Bucket policy to allow objects in the bucket to be retrieved by anyone.


.. find-out-more:: Info on public buckets created prior to April 2023

    Amazon S3 buckets created before April 2023 supported using ACLs for public read access to files.
    This functionality has since been deprecated, and only remains for legacy buckets.
    When dealing with an old S3 bucket using ACLs like that, it is possible to use the deprecated ``public`` parameter and set it to "yes".

    - ``public=yes``: Set to "yes" to allow public read access to files sent to the S3 remote


Lastly, for git-annex to be able to download files from the bucket without requiring your
AWS credentials, it needs to know where to find the bucket. We do this by setting the bucket
URL, which takes a standard format incorporating the bucket name and location (see the code block below).
Alternatively, this URL can also be copied from your AWS console.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git annex enableremote public-s3 \
   publicurl="https://$BUCKET.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"
   enableremote public-s3 ok
   (recording state in git...)


Publish the dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The special remote is ready, and now we want to give people seamless access to the
DataLad dataset. A common way to do this is to create a sibling of the dataset on
GitHub using :dlcmd:`create-sibling-github`. In order to link the contents in the
S3 special remote to the GitHub sibling, we also need to configure a publication
dependency to the ``public-s3`` sibling, which is done with the ``publish-depends <sibling>``
option. For consistency, we'll give the GitHub repository the same name as the dataset name. 

.. code-block:: console

   $ datalad create-sibling-github -d . neuro-data-s3 \
   --publish-depends public-s3 --access-protocol ssh
   [INFO   ] Configure additional publication dependency on "public-s3"
   .: github(-) [https://github.com/jsheunis/sample-neuro-data.git (git)]
   'https://github.com/jsheunis/sample-neuro-data.git' configured as sibling 'github' for Dataset(/Users/jsheunis/Documents/neuro-data-s3)

Notice that by creating this sibling, DataLad created an actual (empty) dataset repository
on GitHub, which required preconfigured GitHub authentication details.

The creation of the sibling (named ``github``) can also be confirmed with :dlcmd:`siblings`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ datalad siblings
   .: here(+) [git]
   .: public-s3(+) [git]
   .: github(-) [https://github.com/jsheunis/neuro-data-s3.git (git)]

The next step is to actually push the file content to where it needs to be in order
to allow others to access the data. We do this with :dlcmd:`push --to github`.
The ``--to github`` specifies which sibling to push the dataset to, but because of the
publication dependency DataLad will push the annexed contents to the special remote first.

.. code-block:: console

   $ datalad push --to github
   copy(ok): CHANGES (file) [to public-s3...]
   copy(ok): README (file) [to public-s3...]
   copy(ok): dataset_description.json (file) [to public-s3...]
   copy(ok): sub-01/anat/sub-01_T1w.nii (file) [to public-s3...]
   copy(ok): sub-01/func/sub-01_task-auditory_bold.nii (file) [to public-s3...]
   copy(ok): sub-01/func/sub-01_task-auditory_events.tsv (file) [to public-s3...]
   copy(ok): task-auditory_bold.json (file) [to public-s3...]
   publish(ok): . (dataset) [refs/heads/main->github:refs/heads/main [new branch]]
   publish(ok): . (dataset) [refs/heads/git-annex->github:refs/heads/git-annex [new branch]]

You can now view the annexed file content (with MD5 hashes as filenames) in the
`S3 bucket <https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3>`_:

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/aws_s3_bucket_full.png

   The public S3 bucket with annexed file content pushed

Lastly, the GitHub repository will also show the newly pushed dataset (with
the "files" being symbolic links to the annexed content on the S3 remote):

.. figure:: ../artwork/src/aws_s3_github_repo.png

   The public GitHub repository with the DataLad dataset


Test the setup!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have now successfully created a DataLad dataset with an AWS S3 special remote for
annexed file content and with a public GitHub sibling from which the dataset can be accessed.
Users can now :dlcmd:`clone` the dataset using the GitHub repository URL:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd /tmp
   $ datalad clone https://github.com/<enter-your-your-organization-or-account-name-here>/neuro-data-s3.git
   [INFO   ] Scanning for unlocked files (this may take some time)
   [INFO   ] Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore
   install(ok): /tmp/neuro-data-s3 (dataset)

   $ cd neuro-data-s3
   $ datalad get . -r
   [INFO   ] Installing Dataset(/tmp/neuro-data-s3) to get /tmp/neuro-data-s3 recursively
   get(ok): CHANGES (file) [from public-s3...]
   get(ok): README (file) [from public-s3...]
   get(ok): dataset_description.json (file) [from public-s3...]
   get(ok): sub-01/anat/sub-01_T1w.nii (file) [from public-s3...]
   get(ok): sub-01/func/sub-01_task-auditory_bold.nii (file) [from public-s3...]
   get(ok): sub-01/func/sub-01_task-auditory_events.tsv (file) [from public-s3...]
   get(ok): task-auditory_bold.json (file) [from public-s3...]
   action summary:
   get (ok: 7)

The results of running the code above show that DataLad could :dlcmd:`install` the dataset correctly
and :dlcmd:`get` all annexed file content successfully from the ``public-s3`` sibling.

Congrats!


Advanced examples - automatically export a hierarchy of datasets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When there is a lot to upload, automation is your friend.
One example is the automated upload of dataset hierarchies to S3

The script below is a quick-and-dirty solution to the task of exporting a hierarchy of datasets to an S3 bucket.
It needs to be invoked with three positional arguments, the path to the :term:`DataLad superdataset`, the S3 bucket name, and a prefix.

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   set -eu
   export PS4='> '
   set -x

   topds="$1"
   bucket="$2"
   prefix="$3"

   srname="${bucket}5"
   topdsfull=$PWD/$topds/

   if ! git annex version | grep 8.2021 ; then
	 echo "E: need recent git annex. check what you have"
	 exit 1
   fi

   { echo "$topdsfull"; datalad -f '{path}' subdatasets -r -d "$topds"; } | \
   while read ds; do
	 relds=$(relpath "$ds" "$topdsfull")
	 fileprefix="$prefix/$relds/"
	 fileprefix=$(python -c "import os,sys; print(os.path.normpath(sys.argv[1]))" "$fileprefix")
	 echo $relds;
	 (
		cd "$ds";
		# TODO: make sure that there is no ./ or // in fileprefix
		if ! git remote | grep -q "$srname"; then
			git annex initremote --debug "$srname" \
				type=S3 \
				autoenable=true \
				bucket=$bucket \
				encryption=none \
				exporttree=yes \
				"fileprefix=$fileprefix/" \
				host=s3.amazonaws.com \
				partsize=1GiB \
				port=80 \
				"publicurl=https://s3.amazonaws.com/$bucket" \
				public=yes \
				versioning=yes
		fi
		git annex export --to "$srname" --jobs 6 main

	)
   done

.. _s3_terraform:

Advanced examples - configure s3 via terraform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using terraform or `tofu <https://opentofu.org/>`_ for managing AWS configuration, you can add an S3 bucket with public read access using this snippet (replacing my-example-bucket with the intended bucket name):

.. code-block:: terraform

   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "datalad_bucket" {
     bucket = "my-example-bucket"
   }

   resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "datalad_bucket_enable_public_read" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.datalad_bucket.id

     block_public_policy     = false
     ignore_public_acls      = false
     restrict_public_buckets = false
   }

   resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "datalad_bucket_read_publicly_policy" {
     depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.datalad_bucket_enable_public_read]
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.datalad_bucket.id
     policy = jsonencode({
       "Version" : "2012-10-17",
       "Statement" : [{
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action" : [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource" : [
           aws_s3_bucket.datalad_bucket.arn,
           "${aws_s3_bucket.datalad_bucket.arn}/*",
         ]
         "Effect" : "Allow",
       }]
     })
   }
