What to do if things go wrong
-----------------------------

After all of the DataLad-101 lectures and tutorials so far, you really begin to
appreciate the pre-crafted examples and tasks the handbook provides.
“Nothing really goes wrong, and if so, it’s intended”, you acknowledge.
“But how does this prepare me for life after the course? I’ve seen a lot of
different errors and know many caveats and principles already, but I certainly
will mess something up at one point. How can I get help, or use the history of
the dataset to undo what I screwed up? Also, I'm not sure whether I know what I
can and can not do with the files inside of my dataset... What if I would
like to remove one, for example?”

Therefore, this upcoming chapter is a series of tutorials about common
file system operations, interactions with the history of datasets, and how
to get help after errors.
