The section below describes something that is very confusing for people that have just started with DataLad: Some files in a dataset can't be modified, and if one tries, it results in a "permission denied" error.
Why is that?
The remainder of this section and the upcoming chapter :ref:`chapter_gitannex` contain a procedural explanation.
However: This doesn't happen on Windows.
The "unlocking" that is necessary on almost all other systems to modify a file is already done on Windows.
Thus, all files in your dataset will be readily modifiable, sparing you the need to adjust to the unexpected behavior that is described below.
While it is easier, it isn't a "more useful" behavior, though.
A different Windows Wit in the next chapter will highlight how it rather is a suboptimal workaround.

Please don't skip the next section -- it is useful to know how datasets behave on other systems.
Just be mindful that you will not encounter the errors that the handbook displays next.
And while this all sounds quite cryptic and vague, an upcoming Windows Wit will provide more information.
