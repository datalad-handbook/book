There is more to DataLad than the Basics. Equipped with the fundamental building
blocks and broad DataLad expertise, you can continue to this advanced section
to read more on how DataLad can be used, from special case applications to
data management at scale.

This part of the book will abandon the DataLad-101 narrative. Consider yourself
graduated. There is no need to read the chapters of this book sequentially. Rather,
find chapters that match your interest and usecase, and read its sections and
associated usecases.
