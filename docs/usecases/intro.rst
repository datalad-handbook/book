**Use cases**
#############

In this part of the book you will find concrete examples of DataLad applications for general
inspiration. You can get an overview of what is possible by browsing through them,
and step-by-step solutions for a range of problems in every single one.
Provided you have read the previous :ref:`basics-intro` sections, the usecases' code
examples are sufficient (though sparser than in Basics) to recreate or apply
the solutions they demonstrate.
