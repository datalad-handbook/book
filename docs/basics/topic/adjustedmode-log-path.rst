A previous Windows Wit already advised to append ``main`` or ``master``, the common "default :term:`branch`", to any command that starts with ``git log``.
Here, the last part of the command specifies a file (``-- recordings/podcasts.tsv``).
Please append ``main`` or ``master`` to ``git log``, prior to the file specification.
