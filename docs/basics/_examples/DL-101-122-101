One can create a new dataset with 'datalad create [--description] PATH'.
The dataset is created empty
'datalad save [-m] PATH' saves the file (modifications) to history.
Note to self: Always use informative, concise commit messages.
The command 'datalad install [--source] PATH' installs a dataset from e.g. a URL or a path.
If you install a dataset into an existing dataset (as a subdataset), remember to specify the
root of the superdataset with the '-d' option.
